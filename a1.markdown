Service Management
==================

-   Services are deployed as containers (Please refer to the Service
    > document to learn how services are shipped, separately). \[Todo -
    > Link\]

-   We also use **Nomad** (Please refer to the Infrastructure document
    > to learn how and why Nomad fits in the pieces) \[Todo - Link\]

List all Services 
------------------

[[Nomad UI]{.underline}](http://10.10.16.204:4646/ui/jobs) gives status
of all services. There would be one job per service per environment with
naming convention (servicename\_env).

This page has a searchable, sortable, paginated table of all jobs,
regardless of job status. This page will automatically update as jobs
are started, stopped, and allocations transition through states.

Jobs can be filtered for specific environment using search box
